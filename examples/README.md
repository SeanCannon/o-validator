# Validation Examples

This directory shows an example of how validations can be run in a more complex scenario.

This structure creates generic validators in `validators.js` to be used later, when called upon. It also exposes more advanced techniques like `validate.all` and `validate.any`.

To view the output, run

```
$ node post.js
```

Try changing the validator or the data in `data.js` to see how validation results change.
